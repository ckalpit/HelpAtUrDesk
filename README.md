# HelpAtUrDesk
Help at ur desk is an application to provide study material.

Problem: 
A student want to have the university notes and assignments but he can not have it, some of them can be available online but still it is online and not available offline, in that case if a user want to have all the study material related to his academics stored in his device he can not have as no application is storing data offline and there is not any existing application  where university's faculties posting their assignments and notes.

Solution:
	Designing an application that will fetch the data from the server and store the data into application so the user can access it whenever he want to. user just need to have internet connectivity once a day so the application will auto update its database and whenever the user want to see the answer he/she can see the solution or the lecture notes offline in mobile/tab.

For getting data,lecture notes, and assignment there is one blog of my own where faculty can post about the assignments or notes.

Application fetches the data from the blog in json form using an api modified according to need and then stores it in to application.Also  a user can share the specific answer using the application if he likes the answer and want others to know about it.
